**Title:** Battery Capacity Degradation on Model X (2017-2019)

**Affected Models:** Tesla Model X (2017-2019)

**VIN Range:** Not applicable

**Issue Description:** A consistent decrease in battery capacity, leading to reduced range and charging issues.

**Conditions:** The issue occurs over time and is more noticeable after prolonged use under extreme temperatures or heavy charging/discharging cycles.

**Diagnostic Findings:** Reduced battery range compared to previous performance, longer charging times, and battery pack temperature fluctuations.

**Root Cause:** Degradation of the lithium-ion cells within the battery pack due to natural aging and usage patterns.

**Recommended Fix:** Replace the affected battery modules as necessary to restore capacity and range. Refer to the Tesla Service Information System (TSIS) for detailed instructions on module replacement.

**Firmware/Software Version (if applicable):** The issue is not software-related; it concerns the physical degradation of the battery pack.

**Repair Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours per module, depending on accessibility and labor efficiency.

**Notes:** Ensure proper handling and disposal of used battery modules in accordance with local environmental regulations. Use genuine Tesla replacement parts to maintain optimal performance and safety standards.
